''' For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "def round10(num):" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as round_sum(). '''

# round_sum(16, 17, 18) → 60
# round_sum(12, 13, 14) → 30
# round_sum(6, 4, 4) → 10

def round_sum(a, b, c):
  return round10(a) + round10(b) + round10(c)
  
def round10(num):
  reminder = num % 10
  if reminder < 5:
    num -= reminder
    return num
  else:
    num += (10 - reminder)
    return num
